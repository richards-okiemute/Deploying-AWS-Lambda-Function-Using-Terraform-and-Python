This project demonstrates how to deploy an AWS Lambda function using Terraform and Python. It includes setting up an AWS S3 bucket as a remote backend for Terraform state, configuring DynamoDB for state locking, and defining IAM roles and policies for Lambda execution. The Lambda function, written in Python, calculates the area and perimeter of a circle. Terraform is used to automate the deployment of all resources.
